            Humans keeps on exploring new and new ways to learn and enhance there lifestyle.
            But there are many whi don't have the structure to build more dreams and catch the world's 
            ongoing speed of evolvement. They have the ability to learn and expand the skills.
            But they don't have oppourtunityor they don't know about the oppourtunities. Every Country
            wants there citizens to be literate, so that they have certain knowledge of world and 
            have understanding. Country looks over this approaching many ways but truth is each and 
            every person can't reach everyone.
